# Spotify Playlist Generator Environment Configuration

# Enable mock services for development/testing
# Set to "true" to use mock services instead of real Spotify API
# Useful for development without needing real Spotify credentials
VITE_USE_MOCK_SERVICES=false

# Enable debug logging
VITE_DEBUG=false

# Note: No API keys needed in .env since Spotify Client ID is entered in the UI
# This allows users to use their own Spotify App credentials
